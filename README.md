**Audentes** (AnonymousDoubts)

This project mainly involves android app development with Firebase as a backend service. We followed an incremental approach to deliver this application. 

The following are the primary objectives from a user perspective:
1) A teacher should be able to create a virtual classroom and add students.
2) A student, once registered in a virtual classroom, should be able to ask doubts anonymously during the class hours using this application.
3) Students and teachers should be able to register/create multiple virtual classrooms.

The following are secondary objectives:
1) A foolproof method to monitor or restrict undesired activity by a student, should be enforced.
2) A digital attendance system must be associated with each virtual classroom, possibly with reminders to users at appropriate times.
